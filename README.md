## Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is designed to be a gallery to display images taken while hiking on trails around Ireland.
The main objective is to provide enjoyment to the user and lead them through to the various social media platforms and join a wider hiker's community. The end goal is to create a sharing ok knowledge, hints, experience and tips to current and aspiring hikers.

### Functionality
The website is laid out over four different pages. The main landing page featutes a bootstrap navbar and an anchor tag leading directly to the gallery page.
The main navbar is consistent throughout the project in its style and functionality. It is designed to condense to a drop down list on mobile devices.
