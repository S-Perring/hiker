## Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is designed to be a gallery to display images taken while hiking on trails around Ireland.
The main objective is to provide enjoyment to the user and lead them through to the various social media platforms and join a wider hiker's community. The end goal is to create a sharing ok knowledge, hints, experience and tips to current and aspiring hikers.

### Functionality
The website is laid out over four different pages. The main landing page features a Bootstrap navbar and an anchor tag leading directly to the gallery page.
The main navbar is consistent throughout the project in its style and functionality. It is designed to condense to a drop-down list on mobile devices.
The gallery page features a hover function where the images enlarge as the user hovers over them. The contact page features a Bootstrap contact form which was amended to fit the purpose and style required but is not linked to a back-end database.

### UX
The page is designed to be simple and allow the images to be the centre piece of the user experience. The main background image is used on the home, about and contact pages. 
I chose not to use the main image in the gallery section. I felt the gallery images should stand alone and the page could look cluttered and overwhelming to the user with the background image in place.
White and purple were used to compliment the colour scheme throughout the website. The main navbar in the gallery uses this colour scheme to allow the header to stand out and provide the user with a consistency of user functionality and colour scheme.
The links to the social media accounts are not hooked up but are presented to encourage the user the click through and join the online community in accordance with the main objective of the project.
My User Experience Design documentation helped in the original mapping and planning for the project. It is available for review in GitHub through the links below.

### Additional features and project expansion
The primary and initial focus of the project is to promote hiking and encourage the creation of an online hiking community through the website as an initial gateway and on to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. 
There is the possibility to add the option to purchase the images and to add a further area with product recommendations for both camera equipment and hiking equipment. This could also provide the opportunity for affiliate marketing.

### Technologies Used
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap 4
+ Javascript
+ Cloud 9
+ Ubuntu
+ Git
+ GitHub

### Deployment
The website was created in Cloud9 and deployed in GitHub pages. The website can be found here [https://s-perring.github.io/hiker/]
The deployed site will update automatically as improvements and updates and pushed to the repository from the Cloud9 coding platform. 
All coding and initial testing was completed in Cloud9. This platform was used to write the HTML and CSS codes. The display and functionality were tested using Cloud9 and Google developer tools.
I used the following process to deploy written and tested code to my GitHub repository;
+ git add .
+ git commit -m "description of update"
+ git push
+ username
+ password

In GitHub I changed the GitHub Pages option in settings to "Master Branch" to project the page from my repository. 


### Testing
Testing was carried out as the project build was ongoing. Using Cloud9 and Google developer tools to test the look, feel and functionality of the project.
Having originally used the main image as the background for the gallery I decided to go for a plain background to declutter the page. During testing I added a media query to enlarge the text on the about page as it looked too small on larger screens.
The Bootstrap contact form was modified to alter the look and custom CSS was added to both the Bootstrapoostrap navbar and contact form.
Following advice from my mentor I reduced the size of the images to facilitate faster loading and prevent negative point scoring in the Google search optimisation.
The website was tested on Chrome, IE, iPhone 6/7/8 and Samsung S5 as well as Google developer tools. 
The links were tested as well as the look and transformation of the presented site on the respective screen size/browser.
I used regular pushes to the Git repository to ensure my work was saved and provide version control should it be necessary.
During testing I used multiple CSS queries to provide the look and feel I wanted for all pages and to provide a consistency of font and colour scheme throughout the pages. I also used CSS to ensure the presentation of the images and forms provided a good UX experience for the user at all stages.

### Code Credits and Personal Credits
+ I used a Bootstrap navbar and copied the code for this and the required JS at the bottom of the page to facilitate the functionality
+ I used a Bootstrap contact form and added both custom CSS and altered the copied code myself to provide the required look and feel.
+ Google searches were used to provide inspiration and hints when I found myself stuck for specific pieces of code but no code was copied directly.
+ All the images were taken by me.
+ Credit to my mentor Spencer Barriball for his expertise and tips to improve my site.
